# MyPlotKit
Useful scripts for Python's [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) to optimize your code.


## Content

Check out the Jupyter notebook [`Optimal_subplot_partition`](Optimal_subplot_partition.ipynb) for a one-liner that gives your program the ability to create an (almost) arbitrary number of subplots.


## Usage

How to use the scripts of this repository in your program is explained within each file (or self-explanatory).
If you use it, you will make me very happy by adding a link to this GitHub-repository.
